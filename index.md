```Java
class Utilities {
public static ArrayList<Product> toProductArrayList(Product[] arr){
    /*List<Product> list = new ArrayList<Product>(Arrays.asList(arr));*/
    ArrayList<Product> arrList = new ArrayList<Product>();
    //I changed the for each loop to a standard for loop since it was giving me a for issues and flooding the array with null
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
      arrList.add(arr[i]);
    }
    return arrList;

  }

  public static double roundToHundreths(double input){
    input *= 100;
    input = Math.floor(input);
    input /= 100;
    return input;
  }
